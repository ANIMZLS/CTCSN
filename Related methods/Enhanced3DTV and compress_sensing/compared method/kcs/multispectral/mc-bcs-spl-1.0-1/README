OVERVIEW:

  These MATLAB programs implement the Motion-Compensated Block Compressed
  Sensing - Smoothed Projected Landweber (BCS-SPL) algorithm as described in
  paper:
  
    S. Mun and J. E. Fowler, "Residual Reconstruction For Block-
    Based Compressed Sensing of Video," to appear in the Data
    Compression Conference, 2011

  Note that, since most of this code relies on random projections,
  the results produced may differ slightly in appearance and
  value from those of the paper.
